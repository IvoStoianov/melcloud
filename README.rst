MELCloud Library
================

A module providing access to Mitsubishi's `MELCloud <https://www.melcloud.com/>`_ API. This API
is not officially documented, but has been reverse-engineered by some diligent users. This API
is relied upon for several projects, so it should be pretty stable, but remember to take the
necessary precautions in your application.

**This library should be considered alpha-state software at present.**

Installing
----------

You can install this module in the usual way. ::

    pip install melcloud

This will install the module with all its dependencies.

Usage
-----

**Please note**: This library is currently only read-only and provides read-only access to your MELCloud data.

We don't have any documentation just yet - why not check out the ``examples/`` directory, and take a look at the code?

----

This library would not have been possible without the work of `ilcato <https://github.com/ilcato/homebridge-melcloud/>`_
and `Simon "mgeek" Rubuano <http://mgeek.fr/blog/un-peu-de-reverse-engineering-sur-melcloud>`_. Many thanks to both
of these people for their diligence!
